# The Daily Tulip

- Assignment: created a news site focusing on responsive design, utilizing css grid and css flexbox.
- Task Approach: (1) startup: brainstorming, reviewing examples, picking out desirable features, reviewing CSS concepts; (2) coding: implementing features, testing out designs; (3) closing: comparing project with assigned requirements, finalizaing project.
- Tools used: Visual Studio Code (to code), Unsplash (to populate assets), GitHub (to commit), CodePen (to test CSS), Netlify (to host), YouTube (to review concepts), Google Search (to find answers), ChatGPT (to find explanations).
- Planning method: established project scope, developed an action plan, determined resources, created a schedule.
- If you had more time, what would be next? The project is a single webpage hosted on Netlify that incorporates all the elements of the project brief. If I had more time I would populate the website with more pages so the main navigation links led to other pages with content on it.
