# The Daily Tulip

## Assignment
Created a news site focusing on responsive design using CSS Grid and Flexbox.

## Task Approach
### Startup:
During the initial phase, I brainstormed different website ideas, reviewed examples for inspiration, and refreshed my knowledge of **CSS Grid** and **Flexbox**. This helped me decide on a layout structure that would be both visually appealing and functional across different devices.

### Development:
The main coding phase involved setting up the layout using **CSS Grid** for the overall structure and **Flexbox** for responsiveness. I tested the design on various screen sizes to ensure it looked good on mobile devices as well. I also worked on making sure images resized correctly, particularly the hero image, which was a bit tricky.

### Closing:
After finishing the initial layout, I compared the site to the project requirements to ensure all features were included. I polished the design, tested the layout, and made final adjustments to optimize the overall user experience.

## Tools Used:
- **Visual Studio Code** – Primary editor for writing HTML, CSS, and testing code.
- **Unsplash** – Used to source high-quality images for the project.
- **GitHub** – For version control and tracking progress.
- **Netlify** – Deployed the project and hosted it live.
- **CodePen** – For experimenting with CSS snippets and testing design ideas.
- **ChatGPT** – Helped clarify concepts and troubleshoot coding challenges.

## Planning Method:
- Initially, I focused on defining the scope of the project, ensuring that I had a clear understanding of the required features.
- I made a rough plan of the tasks needed to accomplish the goals, though I struggled to create a detailed roadmap at first.
- The planning method evolved as I worked, with a lot of the **task planning** happening **on the fly** as I realized what needed to be done.

## GitHub Issues:
- **Issue #1**: Implement the base layout using **CSS Grid**.
This was relatively straightforward, but it took time to ensure the layout worked across different screen sizes.
- **Issue #2**: Ensure mobile responsiveness using **Flexbox**.
Mobile responsiveness was another relatively easy task, but I spent extra time testing and tweaking the layout to ensure it worked well on all screen sizes.
- **Issue #3**: Resolve issues with **hero image** resizing.
The hero image was difficult to make responsive, as I had trouble getting it to scale properly on different devices. After some Google searches and trial and error, I was able to implement a solution that worked across screen sizes.

## Future Plans:
- If I had more time, I would have expanded the project to include additional pages, such as a Contact Us page or a 'Latest News' section with a dynamic feed.
- I would also work on refining the responsiveness and improving the layout further for specific mobile devices.
